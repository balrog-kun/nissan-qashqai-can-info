# Nissan Qashqai J10 CAN bus data

This file contains the list of CAN bus frame formats and semantics discovered by looking at the frames captured
on a manual-transmission diesel 2013 Nissan Qashqai J10.  A portion of the data here applies to other Nissan models like
Juke, Pulsar, Sentra, 370Z, X-Trail, Murano from the same period of time, and to a lesser extent to the
automatic-transmission and electric models (Nissan Leaf).  The automatic-transmission models will have frames 421 and/or
41f, 176 with gearbox information which the manual models don't use.  Some specifics for other models can be found
[here](https://github.com/commaai/opendbc/blob/master/nissan_leaf_2018.dbc),
[here](https://github.com/commaai/opendbc/blob/master/nissan_x_trail_2017.dbc) and
[here](https://github.com/jackm/carhack/blob/master/nissan.md).

Nissan Qashqai, unlike many other cars, only has one major CAN bus with between 6 and 12 devices connected to it
(depending on model configuration) and it's the same bus you can access through the Data Link Connector (connector M4 in
the service manual schematics) or the comfort unit.  The service manuals refer to that bus as "CAN communication" or
"CAN COMM".  There is one other isolated bus using the CAN protocol and it connects the Audio unit to the NAVI unit
who is the master device on that bus.  That bus is referred to as "AV communication" or "AV COMM" in the service manuals.
This file always refers to the main CAN bus.  Both busses run at 500kbps with 11-bit addresses.

I captured the data using an off-the-shelf ESP32 board with an SN65HVD230 CAN transciever who's main function
is to automate the power mirrors folding and unfolding in my car.

## Addressing

This file follows the bit addressing in [this doc](https://github.com/jackm/carhack/blob/master/nissan.md) where CAN
bus message bytes in positions 1 to 8 are referenced by letters A-H and bits are numbered from 8th (MSB) to 1st (LSB).
Bit M in byte N is represented by `N.M`, e.g. the lowest bit of the 3rd byte is `C.1` while the highest bit in
byte 1 -- or the first bit of the entire messsages -- is `A.8`.  Frame IDs (addresses) are hexadecimal.

## Periodic data frames

This lists individual values in the frames transmitted periodically by devices on the main CAN bus, i.e. frames
that don't need to be requested.  Multi-byte values are encoded as big-endian except where noted.

## BCM diagnostic action PIDs (commands)

These are the BCM's service 0x30 PIDs that can be used to send commands and only send commands (there don't seem to be any useful information queries).  The service listens on address **0x745** and replies on address **0x765** but it allows communication only [as documented by Brad370z here](https://projectbytes.wordpress.com/2015/07/08/nissan-370z-can-control/), i.e. in a diagnostic session.  SID 0x30 is known as "I/O control by local ID" in some protocols.

These commands toggle the different lights, actuators, speakers and other devices connected to the BCM, plus it seems the BCM will automatically request power to the right rails on the car from the IPDM-E/R so that the commands mostly work even when the car is completely off.  The changes will time out after 5 seconds so these seem to be strictly diagnostic commands for quickly testing the different devices.  At the same time it seems the changes can be extended in time by resending the commands before the 5s run out.

As documented by Brad370z each command consists of the service number `0x30`, the PID/CID number, the function byte and the requested value.
Three functions seem to available:

| Function byte | Description |
| --: | --- |
| `0x00` | Sends a one-time command such as door unlocking.  Either this or `0x20` is supported by every PID, never both. |
| `0x01` | Queries whether given value is supported by this PID.  Every PID supports this function |
| `0x20` | Causes a temporary 5-second change to a device's state |

Most PID/CIDs support values 0 (off) and 1 (on).  For function `0x00` requesting the value 0 does nothing.  For function `0x20` the value 0 disables a device temporarily if it's on, and cancels a previously requested value that hasn't timed out yet.  For example if the left turn signal is currently blinking because the turn signal & wiper switch (stick/lever) is in the left position, requesting value will 1 will start blinking the right turn signal (and disable the left turn signal) for 5 seconds.  Requesting value 0 will disable either turn signal for 5s whether it was requested with the physical switch or a diagnostic command.

## Engine ECU diagnostic action PIDs (commands)

The engine computer seems to have its own service 0x30 to trigger diagnostic actions, with a similar syntax to the BCM's service 0x30.  The service 0x30 commands as well as the diagnostic session request (`02 10 c0`) now need to be sent to address **7e0** instead of **745**.  The function byte is always `00` and the value byte is apparently ignored, so the functions and values are not listed below.

These commands can't be used when the engine is running, error `22` (conditionsNotCorrect) is returned if they're attempted with the engine running.  Similarly some of the commands return error `22` if a previous related command is still in effect.  The PID/CIDs may be specific to the K9K engine or a subset of engines.

| PID | Action |
| --: | --- |
| 03 | Runs the radiator for 2-3 secs |
| 04 | Runs the radiator for 2-3 secs |
| 11 | _TODO_ |
| 12 | _TODO_ (2 or 3 quiet tick sounds in 2 sec intervals)
| 13 | _TODO_ |
| 14 | _TODO_ |
| 17 | _TODO_ |
| 18 | _TODO_ (makes a quiet ~5 Hz ticking noise from engine room for ~5 secs) |
| 22 | _TODO_ |
| 26 | _TODO_ |
| 35 | _TODO_ |
| 36 | _TODO_ |
| 37 | _TODO_ |
| 38 | _TODO_ |
| 41 | _TODO_ |
| 42 | _TODO_ |
| 43 | _TODO_ |

Some or all of these may correspond to test commands (_TODO: find matches_), note this list is a mix of lists from different ECUs:
| ID | Action |
| --: | --- |

## IPDM-E/R diagnostic action PIDs (commands)

These are the diagnostic PIDs/CIDs for the IPDM-E/R ECU (or BCM?) at address **74d**.  Like before diagnostic session `0xc0` required.

## Standard service 01 PIDs (current data)

This is the supported subset of the standard ECU service 01 PIDs just as [described on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs#Service_01).  I captured the values with the engine off, ignition in ON on my 2013 manual transmission diesel J10.  Any PIDs not listed here seem to be unsupported.  The queries are sent to the address **7e0** and the replies are returned from address **7e8**.

| PID | Meaning | Unit (formula to get physical value) | Captured value |
| --: | --- | --- | --- |
| 00 | _Supported PIDs 01-1f bitmask_ || `98 3b 80 11` |
| 01 | Monitor status since DTCs cleared | bitmap | `00 64 80 00` (Diesel engine, Components test incomplete, Fuel test incomplete, EGR System test available) |
| 04 | Calculated engine load | % (100/255 A) | `00` |

| 31 | Distance traveled since codes cleared | km (256A+B) | `03 7c` |

## Standard service 09 PIDs (vehicle information)

As before this is the supported subset of the standard ECU service 09 PIDs just as [described on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs#Service_09).  Any PIDs not listed here seem to be unsupported, i.e. very little is actually supported and the VIN query (02), while available, returns no data.  The other two PIDs have lengths that don't match the specs.

| PID | Meaning | Value |
| --: | --- | --- |
| 00 | _Supported PIDs 01-1f bitmask_ | `54 00 00 00` |
| 02 | [Vehicle Identification Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Identification_Number) (VIN) | `01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff` |

| 06 | Calibration Verification Numbers (CVN) Several CVN can be output (4 bytes each) the number of CVN and CALID must match | `01 44 d8 62 a7` |

## Non-standard service 22 PIDs

These are the manufacturer-specific service 22 PID/CIDs that can be queried for current values from sensors, internal BCM/Engine state and/or hardcoded information.  They're read in the same way as services 01 and 09 except for the PID/CID numbers being 16-bit.  SID 0x22 is known as "Read Data by Common Identifier" (CID, or Data Identifier - DID)

## BCM non-standard service 21 PIDs

These are some manufacturer-specific service 21 PID/CIDs that can be queried for BCM information.  They're read in the same way as services 01 and 09 but only within a diagnostic session (command `10 c0`).  In a normal session the reads will return error 0x80.  SID 0x21 is known as "Read Data by Local Identifier" in some protocols.

## Other ECUs non-standard service 21 PIDs

These are some manufacturer-specific service 21 PID/LIDs that can be queried for ECU information.  They're read in the same way as services 01 and 09 but there are no supported PID bitmasks for the LIDs after 0x80.  SID 0x21 is known as "Read Data by Local Identifier" in some protocols.

## Non-standard service 0x23 (ROM dump)

Apparently the Engine ECU (address **7e0**) and the BCM (address **745**) implement service 0x23 but I've been unable to get any data out of them so far.  SID 0x23 is known as "Read Memory by Address" in some procotols.  The message syntax is [as described in this blog post](https://leftoverpi.com/2020/01/23/reading-a-370z-ecu-rom/), i.e. the command consists of the length byte (`07`), the Service ID (`23`), the 32-bit big-endian read start address and the 16-bit big-endian number of bytes to read, e.g. `07 23 00 00 12 34 00 3f` to request 63 bytes starting at memory address 0x1234.  The command returns error `0x7f` if attempted in the normal session mode.  In that (370Z-specific) blog post those commands are executed in the `0xfb` session (`elevatedDiagSession`) but that mode is not supported on the J10 Qashqai.  However, executing the command in session `0xc0` mode (`startDiagSession`) resolves the `0x7f` error and instead error `0x12` (`subFunctionNotSupported-invalidFormat`) is then returned.  In session `0x85` error `0x11` is returned.  More research needed.

## TO DO

Write the [DBC file](https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/can-dbc-file-database-intro) for the periodic messages and the information PID queries perhaps using the free online editor.

Find out a message combination to stop the engine, perhaps by imitating the periodic messages.

Data available on some cars but not available on Nissan Qashqai J10 or yet to be decoded:
* Fuel level
* Outside temperature
* Outside brightness level (bright/dark, from the Light & Rain sensor)
* Seatbelt status and occupancy sensor status other than driver
* Car VIN
* Current time and/or date
* Current GPS lat/lon/number of satellites
